# DivisionGame

The idea is that there is a grid of numbers and numbered frogs on the left hand
side. You give them a starting point on the grid and then they move across the
numbers they divide towards the right hand side. The player picks a route.

## Possible extensions

* Each number can only be used N times.
* UI with drag and drop.
