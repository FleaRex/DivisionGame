# DivisionGame

The idea is that there is a grid of numbers and a numbered skater on the left
hand side. You pick a route across the grid of numbers that the number on the
skater divides.

To use this you will need to host a server, for instance using http-server,
which you can get from npm. (https://www.npmjs.com/package/http-server)
